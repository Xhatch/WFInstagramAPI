# Contributing

Please fork & submit pull requests! I think there's a good groundwork laid with the current state of the library, but there's lots of Instagram API concepts and endpoints that haven't been modeled yet. Additionally, it would be nice to make it easier to use the library in desktop OS X development in addition to iOS. And if you use the library you'll probably find lots of important things that haven't been implemented yet.
